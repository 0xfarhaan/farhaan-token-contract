# Token Contract

This project is to practice the creation of a token contract. By using this app you can read the balance
of Farhaan Tokens and send Farhaan tokens.

## Interacting with the Contract

In the project directory, you can run:
```
npm run start
```
Ensure you have the Metamask extension installed, switch over to the Ropsten testnet
and have some testnet ETH to be able to change the greeting.
